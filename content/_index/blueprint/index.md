CDT Cloud Blueprint is a <em>template tool</em> for building custom, web-based C/C++ tools. It is based on existing open source components from inside and outside of CDT Cloud to provide a typical C/C++ IDE based on the Eclipse Theia platform. The feature set includes C/C++ language editing support, debugging, memory analysis and trace visualization. Besides demonstrating CDT Cloud capabilities, CDT Cloud Blueprint also serves as a starting point for the implementation of a custom C/C++ IDE.
