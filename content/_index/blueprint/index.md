CDT Cloud Blueprint is a template tool for building custom, web-based C/C++ tools. It is made of existing open source components and provides a typical C/C++ IDE based on the Eclipse Theia platform. This includes C/C++ language features, a language server, debugging support, memory debugging and a tracing view. It is meant to serve as a starting point for the implementation of domain-specific custom tools. For a simple showcase, CDT Cloud Blueprint can be easily downloaded and installed on all major operating system platforms.

<p style='text-align: center;'>CDT Cloud Blueprint is <b>not a production-ready product</b>. Therefore, it is also not meant to be a replacement for Eclipse CDT or any other IDE (yet).</p>
