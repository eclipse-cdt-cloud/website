CDT Cloud Blueprint provides two extension mechanisms for maximum flexibility.
First, CDT Cloud Blueprint supports VS Code extensions, e.g. to be installed from the [openVSX](https://open-vsx.org) marketplace.
Therefore you can easily extend CDT Cloud Blueprint with additional features from the huge ecosystem.
Second, by using Theia extensions, you can extend, adapt or even replace almost every aspect of CDT Cloud Blueprint.
Therefore, you can fully customize the blueprint to your specific and domain-specific needs and create a fully custom and white-label tool.
