CDT.cloud Blueprint consists enitrely of open source components. Even more, all components are released under licenses that are friendly to commercial use (mostly EPL and MIT). Therefore, you can adopt CDT.cloud Blueprint to build your own tool and provide it to your customers with a commercial license. Last but not least most components of CDT.cloud (e.g. Theia itself) are backed by the strong support of companies in the [Eclipse Cloud Dev Tools Working Group](https://ecdtools.eclipse.org).
