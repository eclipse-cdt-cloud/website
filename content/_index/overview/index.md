<p style='text-align: center;'>
CDT.cloud Blueprint is a template tool for building custom, web-based C/C++ tools. It is made of existing open source tool components and provides a typical C/C++ IDE based on the Eclipse Theia platform. This includes C/C++ language features, a language server, debugging support, a memory view and a tracing view. It can serve as a default starting point for the implementation of a custom, domain-specific tool. For a simple showcase, CDT.cloud Blueprint can be easily downloaded and installed on all major operating system platforms (see above).

<p style='text-align: center;'>CDT.cloud Blueprint is <b>not a production-ready product</b>. Therefore, it is also not meant to be a replacement for Eclipse CDT or any other IDE, yet.</p>
<p style='text-align: center;'>CDT.cloud Blueprint is in an early alpha state and under active development. <a href="https://twitter.com/CdtCloud">Follow us on twitter</a> to be notified about recent updates to the project. Get in contact with us to learn more or join this initiative</p>
