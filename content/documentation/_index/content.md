CDT.cloud hosts reusable components and best practices for building web-based, custom C/C++ tools based on a modern technology stack.
Thus, CDT.cloud is not one single framework, but rather an ecosystem of platforms, components and frameworks that can be combined into a custom tool for a specific environment, e.g. an IDE for embedded software development with a specific family of boards.

To learn more about building a custom tool with CDT.cloud, involved platforms, components and frameworks, please use the table of contents on the left to navigate through the documentation pages.

➡️ A great starting point is the [Overview]({{< relref "overview" >}}) section.

The source code of the CDT.cloud components is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/cdt-cloud).
With [CDT.cloud Blueprint]({{< relref  "/#blueprint" >}}), there is also an example tool that demonstrates a custom C/C++ tool based on CDT.cloud.
Also check out the [additional external articles and videos about CDT.cloud]({{< relref  "additionals" >}}).

We are continuously working on improving this documentation. If you feel something is missing, please file an issue and open a PR at the [website repository](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/website).

If you need more help, please have a look at our [available support options]({{< relref  "/support" >}}).
